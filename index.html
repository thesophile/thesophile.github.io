            <h1>Welcome to Sophile</h1>
            <p class="left-aligned"> On 2019, I started a youtube channel to make learning more fun.
                The idea was to encourage intuitive understanding rather than rote memorization with 
                a focus on mathematics and physics. It made me sad how
                most of my peers either just memorized these equations or hated these 
                subjects thinking that it's all about some stupid equations to memorize. And my school and tuition
                 systems was like that; they just taught us musical notes without playing the notes.
                 Many students missed out on the beutiful music they never heard because their teachers
                 were too focused on making us regurgitate the notes on exams.
                 It was all about the exams. I wanted that to change, that is why
                 I started this channel.
            </p>
            <p class="left-aligned">
                But, I soon realized my videos were not popular at all- 2 or 3 accidental clicks- 
                that's all I got, so why bother? But I noticed that in the 
                process of making these videos, I learned a lot that more than 
                I started with- It was fun! So I kept making these videos. It was a hobby for me.

            </p>
            <p class="left-aligned">
                In the later years, I started learning web development and made 
                SSLC percentage Calculator to help students calculate their grade
                after SSLC examinations, an important exam in Kerala. While struggling
                with memorizing chemical reactions for my plus two lab, I made 
                a Virtual Lab to help me and others like me to do the experiments at home.
            </p>
            <p class="left-aligned">
                In these plus two years, another thing happened; I fell in love with physics!
                I loved imagining things and applying the equations 
                I learned to that situation. For example, I would
                imagine a particular configuration of charges and 
                apply some basic equations to predict how it would behave.
                The interesting part is when the results are counter-intuitive. 
                Then you learn a new thing about nature.
            </p>
            <p class="left-aligned">
                So naturally, I took a Bsc in Physics, but somwhere
                lost my passion for physics. Anyway, too much about myself, 
                I learned blender and made some animations on physics.
                I noticed that there was no good animation explaining
                the Foucault pendulum. So I made one. It has now over 52,000
                views. I am proud to say that my video has helped that many people. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-aligned">
                I have made a website where you can download calicut
                university textbooks and other study materials. There is also a telegram
                channel for the same purpose. 
                I have also made more websites some of which can be
                accessed at <a href="https://github.com/abhinavpbabu">github.com/abhinavpbabu</a>. I was busy 
                making the CloudPy website so I haven't been able to post much.
                I am planning to make more videos whenever I have time.
                I will start completing the bsc physics playlists when I left unfinished.   
                
                
            </p>

            <p class="left-aligned"> 
                Thank you for all the support and the 1,000 subscribers.
                I know it's not a big number in Youtube terms but I am  
                proud that I have been helpful to 1000 people.
                Thank you again!
